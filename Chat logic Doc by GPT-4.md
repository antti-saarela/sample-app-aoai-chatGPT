This is a React component for a chat interface that interacts with the Python Flask web application you provided earlier. The chat interface allows users to ask questions and receive answers from the AI model. It also supports displaying citations for the answers provided by the AI.  
   
Here's a brief overview of the component:  
   
1. The component uses React hooks to manage its state, such as `isLoading`, `showLoadingMessage`, `activeCitation`, `isCitationPanelOpen`, and `answers`.  
2. The `getUserInfoList` function is used to check if the app has authentication configured. If not, it displays a message to the user about configuring authentication.  
3. The `makeApiRequest` function sends the user's question to the Flask backend, which then communicates with Azure OpenAI to get the answer. The function also handles streaming responses and error handling.  
4. The `clearChat` function clears the chat history.  
5. The `stopGenerating` function stops the AI from generating more content.  
6. The component renders the chat interface, including the input field for asking questions, the chat history, and the citation panel if any citations are available.  
7. The `onShowCitation` function is used to display the citation panel with the selected citation's information.  
   
This chat component can be integrated into a React application to provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the AI model through the Flask web application.
